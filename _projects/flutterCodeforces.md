title: Codeforces Flutter App
---

This is a simple flutter application I built as part of my learning. In this app, one can enter a valid codeforces handle and get three types of graphs in three tab views in
return.

## Views

The graphs one can view are:
 - A pie chart on the types of recent 10 problems solved.
 - A bar chart on the verdicts on those 10 problems.
 - A line graph of the rating change of the codeforces handle from the beginning till now.
 
The codeforces official API was used in this flutter application. I tried to add a short video of the flutter app in the following section:

<video width="600" height="400" controls loop>
  <source src="/portfolio/theme/img/CF_Flutter.webm" type="video/mp4">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

## More

The link to the GitHub repository of this project is [here](https://github.com/Abdus-Samee/Codeforces-Api-Flutter-App). You can download the zip of the folder or git it. Enjoy it!
This app still needs a lot of modification and UI design. I hope to add those to the GitHub repository soon.
