title: Drum playing site

## About

I made this website as a fun project. It uses JavaScript listener to listen to keypresses and mouse clicks on the alphabet-tagged buttons and play relevant sounds.

## Views

I tried to add a short video of the project in the following section:

<video width="320" height="240" autoplay>
  <source src="/portfolio/theme/img/drum.mp4" type="video/mp4">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

## More

The link to the GitHub repository of this project is [here](https://github.com/Abdus-Samee/ScreenShare). You can download the zip of the folder or git it. Remember, you have to start the server before the client in order for the project to work. Last but not the least, openjdk-14 was used here. So be sure to check the project structure and the configuration before running the program.
