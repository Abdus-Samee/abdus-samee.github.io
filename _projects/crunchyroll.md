My project for the lab course of Database where I built an anime and manga streaming site with React at frontend, Node at backend, and Oracle as the database. The main
focus was to design the database and implement it.

I am attaching herewith the YouTube link of the [project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB9KNY6kMsU).

Some features of an anime/manga streaming website were implemented in this project, for instance:
 - User authentication system.
 - Separate section for animes and mangas.
 - Users buying premium packages can only access the premium contents.
 - Once the premium plan duration is over, the user has to buy a new one in order to continue their watch of premium contents.
 - There is also a separate blog section where only admins write posts, but anyone can comment on them.
 - Users can also rate and comment on individual animes and mangas, obviously within the premium content buying rules.
