I am attaching herewith the live link of the [website](http://laravel-car-warehouse.herokuapp.com).

I tried to portray variuous features of a car buying-selling website in a beginner level. I aimed at using various inbuilt features of Laravel and shape up my knowledge. I tried
to:
 - Add a user authentication system.
 - Include a live search of cars.
 - Store images in the mysql database without storing in the storage folders.
 - Reply users with e-mails upon creating account and buying/selling a car.
 - Introduce notification system for particular user which can be marked read from unread.
 - Incorporate attractive front-end(although most credit goes to various YouTubers and their dedicated tutorials) as much as I can comprehend.
