This post demonstrates all the projects I've done in my undergrad life till now, including short description about each of them and the provided github repository link. The projects here are purely academic.

## Level-1, Term-1

We were assigned to a group of two in order to accomplish this project. The mode of coding was `C` and we had to use a special graphics library called `iGraphics`. This is the first proect of my undergrad life. I, along with my teammate, built a simple `DX Ball` game with three levels and a scoreboard.

The link to the GitHub repository is [here](https://github.com/Abdus-Samee/DX-Ball-Game).

<div id="carouselExampleControls" class="carousel slide mb-4" data-ride="carousel">
    <div class="carousel-inner">
        {% for img in page.images %}
            <div class="carousel-item {% if forloop.first %}active{% endif %}">
                <img src="{{ img }}" class="d-block w-100" alt="">
            </div>
        {% endfor %}
    </div>
    <a class="carousel-control-prev" href="#carouselExampleControls" role="button" data-slide="prev">
        <span class="carousel-control-prev-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span>
        <span class="sr-only">Previous</span>
    </a>
    <a class="carousel-control-next" href="#carouselExampleControls" role="button" data-slide="next">
        <span class="carousel-control-next-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span>
        <span class="sr-only">Next</span>
    </a>
</div>


## Level-1, Term-2

This term is still ongoing. So, the project work hasn't yet been finalized. Yet again we will be working in a group of two. This time our mode of coding is `Java` and we will be using a special library called `JavaFX`. We tend to use socket programming in our project in order to facilitate the use of multiple clients at a time.
